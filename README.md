### This is a software system for the robot to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube
Here we use two cameras and a robotic arm to flip the cube to achieve the color face of the cube. The method of Jaap Scherphuis is used to solve the execution step of the Rubik's cube, and the robotic arm is solved by the underlying coordinate orientation transformation.  
It is a more faster solution than  Rubik's-Hands
 that I have been built before!
